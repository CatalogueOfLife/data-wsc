# API Data Web Spider Catalog (WSC)
[WSC API](https://wsc.nmbe.ch/dataresources) responses used to build a ColDP archive with the [ColDP Generator](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp-generator).
The API has daily limits that prevent from building a complete archive in one go. We use this repository to store the API responses so we can
use the update API to only look for new or changed content.
